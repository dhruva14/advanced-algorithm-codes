IMPLEMENTION OF STRASSENS MULTIPLICATION 
by DHRUVA ANAND

Matrix multiplication using
D&C:Divide and conquer
ijk:iterative O(n^3) approach
Strassen:using strassen algorithm

Files starting with P are parallelized using threads.

Time taken for matrices of different sizes is noted for each approach.

Matrix sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096
